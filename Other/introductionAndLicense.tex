\section*{Preface}
I hate writing by hand. I hate trying to catch up to a professor's notes on the board, while also listening to what he has to say. So I set out to type all of the professor's notes into \LaTeX, in order to make a decent booklet to help me study for this course.\\

This document is not supposed to substitute the class notes, instead it is supposed to complement them. You should use this in class, while also checking for errors since document is given ``as is", and therefore it might contain a few mistakes.\\

This document is not finished, and it may never be. If you think something should be added or corrected, head on to the GitHub repository and either open an issue with the suggestion or add/correct it yourself. In order for this document to live on, it needs to be maintained and corrected by everyday students like you.\\

\noindent Enjoy it.
